This technique enhances the cleansing effect and ensures your hair receives the full benefits of the silicone-free formula. After rinsing, follow up with the conditioner, focusing on the ends of your hair to maintain moisture without weighing it down. Regular use will not only keep your hair looking vibrant but also align with your eco-conscious values, thanks to Aveda's sustainable practices.",
